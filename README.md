# ESP8266 Blynk-based LED Strip

This is a small project of mine, an LED strip powered by Espressif 8266 DEVKIT board, and using Blynk as a backend.

### Make sure to fill out src/secrets.h, as well as all the LED strip configurations in src/main.cpp if you want to use this with your own strip!

Only for ESP8266 based boards, may have issues with different types of boards, although fixable by changing the pinouts to your own ones.

### This will soon undergo a complete rewrite, so stay tuned, and any help is appreciated!
